# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project was to provide Louise with applicable data regarding the outcomes of different theatre and play related campaigns so she can have more information regarding what to do for her upcoming campaign. Throughout the project, we narrowed down the dataset to evaluate the success or failure of campaigns based on launch dates and goals set prior to launch . 
### Purpose
To provide Luoise with the relevant data regarding the outcomes of campaigns based on launch date and preset goals. This information will be useful for her current and future campaigns she decides to run.       
## Analysis and Challenges
After thoroughly analyzing the Theatre campaign outcomes based off launch date and Outcomes of all campaigns based on preset goals there were two things that can be said with certainty upon viewing the graphical representation of each correspoding dataset. There outcomes are as follow:
   1. May is the best month to start a campaign, December is the worst.
   2. The success and fail rate of each campaign was almost directly inversed based on the goal that was preset. 



### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
It is very evident from the start that May is the best month of the year to start a theatre campaign. The month of May saw both the highest number of successful campaigns and the highest percentage of successful campaings. After noticing May had the highest number of unsuccessful campaigns I calculated the percentage of successful campaigns and it turns out that May had the highest success rate while December had the worst. With the given information after analysis one may conclude that May and June are the best time of year to launch a campaign. Included below is the graphical representation of the data analyzed above.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Based of the anaylysis of the data categorized in tiers of monetary goals, the percentage of those that were successful and those that were not vary greatly. The most frequently placed goal was between 1,000 and 4,999 dollars. This had the second highest success rate due to the fact that the goal isnt very high. 73 percent of the campaigns with the goal in the aforementioned range was successful. This may be the most relevant data we can find as the number of campaigns ran with goals higher than 35000 were 20 total. 8 of those were successful meaning that there was only a 40% success rate on campaigns with higher goals. The highest success rates fell within the goal ranges of 1-15000. All of these were above 50% and they had the most recorded instances (the mode). Based on the graphed data represented below, you would want to select a goal where you can maximize the space between the succesful and failed line. With the given data set, outside of the easiest goal of 1000, you would likely want to keep your goal somewhere within the 5-14 thousand range.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Some of the difficulties in this dataset included the lack of relevant data that could be categorized as a play. Having more data related to plays may have helped us draw more definitive conclusions regarding success rates based off month launched and goals pledged. To combat this limitations we broadened the analysis to everything under theater. 
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
The biggest conclusion is that May is the month you would choose to start a campaign. After that, June. The second conclusion is that December is not the month to start a campaign if you want it to be a successful one. This is represented in the filtered data AND the graphical representation of that data. 
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
It was evident that the lower goals had a higher success rate and the the higher goals did not. It can be concluded that you likely won't find much success exceeding a goal of 15,000. At the point it is a 50/50 chance on whether or not you are successful . 
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
There was a lot of data on other topics outside of theater and play campaigns. The limited information on play campaigns is definitely something that should be noted and considered when drawing conclusions from this dataset
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
I believe it would have been more beneficial to analyze the raw count of successful and unsuccessful plays based on pledged goal. Since the percentages were naturally going to be inverses of each other, I find that data to not be that useful and difficult to draw conclusions from.
